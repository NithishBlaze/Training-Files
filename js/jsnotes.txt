javascript:
    -it is used to functionalites and actions into web applications
    -it is interpreter language
    -it is loosely typed language
    -javascript is a case sensitive language

    why javascript is loosely typed language?
        -because when we create a variable in javascript we cannotdetermine what type of data it contain until or unless the variableis initialized 
        -in javascript variablewe can store multiple type of data in it that's why it is called as loosely typed language. 

how to use javascript
    -there are two ways to use javascript
     1.internal javascript: in html we use script tag and in that we wite js code.
     2.external javascript: in this we create a seperate js file and import that js file and import that js file in html file by using script tag

hot to get output in javascript

    1.document.write(): it will display output in html page
    2.window.alert(): it will display output in model popup window
    3.console.log(): it will display output in browser control or in terminal
    4.innerHTML(DOM): it will display output inside an element

Hoisting: moving variable declaration to the top of webpage

Variable : it is used to store data in it.
            -we can create variable in javascript by using var, let, const

var : it create function scope variable
    - we can use variable before its declaration
    - we can re-declare variable

var mydata; //var declaration
var mydata="changepond"; //variable initialization
var mydata= "Nithish"; defining variable

let : it create block scope variable
    - we cannot use variable before its declaration
    - we canot redeclare the variable

const: it create a block scope variable
    -we cannot use variable before its declaration
    -in this when we declare a variable at same time we have initialize it.
    -the data will never change on runtime

datatype in javascript

1.Number
    let no1=231, no2=0.5, no3=987654321;
2.String
    str1="Hello";
3.Boolean
    cond1=true, cond2= false;
4.Null
    let data=null;
5.Undefine
    let city;

userDefined datatype

6.Array
    let std= ["Nithish","Kumar","Blaze"];
7. objectDatatype
    let emp= {id:101,name:"Nithish",post:"JavaDeveloper"};

use of exponentiation (**): it return power of any Number

    console.log(2*2*2*2);
    console.log(2**2);
    console.log(2**3);


equalTo (==) :
    - it check value only and if both are same then it will true value
    5 == 5 //true
    5 == '5' //true
exactlyEqualTo (===)
    - it will check value as well as its dataType and if both are same it returns true value
    5 === 5 //true
    5 === '5' //false


DOM manipulation

function : it is a block od code which is used to perform specific task
    -it will execute when we call the function
    - function can be reused

    1.preDefinedFunctions
        -provided by javascript
    2.userDefinedFunctions
        -user developed for particular use

Syntax:
    function function_name(){
        //statement
    }

    to call the function

    function_name();

parametrized function

    function function_name(parameter1, parameter2){
        return parameter1 + parameter2
    }

anonymous function //function without a name

    let multiply = function(num1,num2){
        return num1*num2 + "<br>";
    };
     document.write(multiply(1,2))

arrow function: function which has no name as well as no function keyword

    let div = (num1,num2) => {
        return num1/num2 + "<br>"
    }

    let div = (num1,num2) => num1/num2 + "<br>"
    
    document.write(div(num1,num2));

optional parameterized function: function in which parameter will be optional

    let fullName = (fname,lname,mname="") =>  fname+mname+lname+ "<br>";

    document.write(fullName("Nithish","Kumar"));
    document.write(fullName("Nithish","Kumar",".R"));

rest parameterized function: when we don't know how many parameters required. so we use spread operator (...)

    let stdList = (...std) =>  std;

        document.write(stdList("Nithish","Kumar", "Blaze", "NithishBlaze"));


Array

    pop is used to remove elements in Array
    push is used to insert elements into the last of Array
    unshift is used to insert element in first of Array



Object : -it is used to store multiple values with different data type
         -in object data store in key and valued paired format
         -we can access object data outside of by writting object.keyName.
         -object type of data can be denoted by {}


callback function: passing a function name as an argument inside another function is called callback function


Date and Time in javascript:
    - if we want to display date and time in javascript first

String and its method:

string: it is a collection of character
        -in string every character has index value and it start from zero
        - in string blank space is also considered as string

 -there are three method which index of serching string
        -indexof(searchingString, startIndex?): 
            - it will search string from left to right and index of first occurences of string
            - it searching string is not found then return -1 as result

        -lastIndexOf(searchingString, startIndex?):
            - it will search string from right to left and index of first occurences of string
            - it searching string is not found then return -1 as result

        -search(searchingString)
            - it will search string from left to right and index of first occurences of string
            - it searching string is not found then return -1 as result
            - it is faster than indexOf method

-there are three methods that returns searching string
        -slice(startIndex,endIndex?):
            -it will return part of string from big string
            -if we write +ve index then it will search from left to right 
            -if we write -ve index then it will search from right to left
        -substring(startIndex,endIndex?):
            -it will return part of string from big string
            -if we write +ve index then it will search from left to right            
        -substr(startIndex,totalNumberOfCharacter);
            -it will return part of string from big string
            -if we write +ve index then will search index from left to right

-charAt
